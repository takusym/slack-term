// Turning a literal `\n` in an argument into a real newline.
//
// WHY this exists at all: this CLI is driven by agents at least as often as by
// people, and an agent composing a message emits `\n` the way it would in JSON —
// it has no shell to interpret it. A person typing into a shell can produce a
// real newline ($'a\nb', or just quoting across lines); an agent building an
// argv array cannot. Without this, every multi-line message an agent sends
// arrives as one line with `\n` printed in it.
//
// WHY `¥n` too: on a Japanese keyboard the ¥ key produces U+00A5 YEN SIGN, not
// U+005C REVERSE SOLIDUS — they are different characters that merely LOOK
// interchangeable, a holdover from Shift-JIS where 0x5C rendered as ¥. Someone
// intending an escape reliably types the one that does nothing. Supporting it
// costs one character in a regex and removes a whole class of "why is my
// message on one line" confusion.
//
// The full-width ￥ (U+FFE5) is deliberately NOT accepted: it is a genuine
// currency glyph that no keyboard produces where a backslash is meant.

/** `\` U+005C, `¥` U+00A5. Not `￥` U+FFE5 — see above. */

 *  `\\` collapses to one `\`, and the following `n` is then ordinary text.
 *  A lead followed by anything else is left alone, so `C:\path` and `¥1000`
