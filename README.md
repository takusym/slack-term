# slack — Slack CLI

A lightweight Slack CLI for quick workspace interaction from the terminal.
Two implementations — **TypeScript** (bun-first, published to npm) and **Rust**
(native binary, `cargo install`) — share one command surface and are verified
byte-for-byte by [`tests/parity.sh`](tests/parity.sh).

## Features

- **News** — Activity feed showing recent mentions (`to:me`), grouped by day with human-readable timestamps
- **Messages** — Browse recent messages across joined channels
- **Tail** — Stream new messages from a channel in real time (like `tail -f`)
- **Search** — Full-text search across the workspace
- **Send** — Send messages to channels, DMs, or threads with a confirm-hash safety gate (prevents accidental sends); targeting a message permalink replies in that message's thread
- **Edit / Delete** — Rewrite or remove a sent message, guarded by the same confirm-hash gate
- **React** — Add or remove an emoji reaction — a lightweight ack that doesn't grow the thread
- **Dump** — Bulk-export channel history as markdown

### Output formatting

- DM channels display as `@DisplayName`, public channels as `#channel-name`
- Slack `<@UID>` mention tokens are resolved to display names
- Slack `<!date^...>` markup is rendered as human-readable dates
- Messages are grouped by day (Today / Yesterday / weekday)

## Comparison with other Slack tools

`slack-term` focuses on everyday workspace interaction through shell commands:
read, search, reply, and coordinate work from a terminal or an agent script.
The alternatives below serve different workflows; links point to their upstream
documentation.

| Tool | Main workflow | How it compares with this project |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`slack-term` (this project)** | Workspace messaging and automation | TypeScript and Rust implementations; explicit user-token setup; message previews and confirm codes for `send`, `edit`, and `delete`; `ask` waits for answers and `todo` tracks tasks through reactions. |
| [`slkcli`](https://github.com/therohitdas/slkcli) | Slack commands for macOS users and agents | Extracts credentials from the Slack desktop app for convenient onboarding. This project offers an explicit-token setup suitable for other platforms, at the cost of configuring an app and scopes. |
| [Official Slack CLI](https://docs.slack.dev/tools/slack-cli/) | Building, running, and deploying Slack apps | Choose it for Slack app development. This project's commands focus on interacting with messages in an existing workspace. |
| [Go `slack-term`](https://github.com/jpbruinsslot/slack-term) | Interactive terminal chat | Provides a full-screen terminal client. This project uses individual shell commands, which fit scripts and quick queries. The two projects are unrelated despite sharing a name. |
| [`wee-slack`](https://github.com/wee-slack/wee-slack) | Slack inside WeeChat | Offers ongoing chat with threads, reactions, and synchronized read markers. Choose it if you already use WeeChat; this project runs as a standalone CLI. |
| [`slackcat`](https://github.com/bcicen/slackcat) | Posting files and piped command output | Focuses on sending stdin, files, and streaming logs to Slack. This project also covers reading, searching, and following conversations. |
| [`slackdump`](https://github.com/rusq/slackdump) | Archiving and exporting Slack data | Offers dedicated archives, export formats, and a local viewer. This project's `dump` provides markdown history exports alongside everyday messaging commands. |

Choose this project when you want **scriptable conversations with a preview before
sending**. The confirmation step adds an extra invocation, and token setup requires
the appropriate Slack scopes. Reactions are immediate and do not use the confirm
gate. For a persistent chat UI or a dedicated archive, the specialized tools above
may be a better fit.

## Installation

### TypeScript (npm, recommended)

One package, no native binaries, any platform with Node 18+.

```sh
npm install -g slack-term
# or: bun add -g slack-term  |  pnpm add -g slack-term
```

> **Note:** Previously published as `@snomiao/slack` (now deprecated).

### Rust (cargo)

```sh
cargo install --path rs
```

Both expose the same `slack` command.

## Usage

```sh
# Activity feed (mentions directed to you)
slack news
slack news --limit 5

# Recent messages across joined channels
slack msgs

# Channel/DM history. Thread parents are marked `[+N replies]`, so a line with
# replies is distinguishable from one without — open it with `slack thread`.
# --json adds reply_count / reply_users_count / latest_reply.
slack read "#general"
slack read "#general" --unreplied   # only threads/posts whose last word isn't yours

# Search messages
slack search "deploy"
slack search "deploy" --count 50

# Send a message (two-step confirm — quote #channel)
slack send "#general" "Hello team"
# Prints who you're acting as (From: @handle (Uxxxx) — Workspace) + a destination
# preview + confirm code; rerun with --code=<code> to actually send. Every gated write
# (send/edit/delete/upload/schedule/channel create/drafts) shows that From: line and
# binds it into the code, so a profile switch mid-flow invalidates it instead of acting
# as the wrong account.
slack send "#general" "Hello team" --code=<code>

# send/edit/ask refuse ambiguous bare URLs such as https://example.com/path/内容.
# Put the URL on its own line or use <https://example.com/path/> (or <url|label>).
# Intentional Unicode URLs should also be wrapped. --allow-url-adjacent warns only;
# the normal confirmation code is still required.

# Reply in a thread — #chan:<thread_ts>, or just paste a message permalink
slack send "#general:1700000000.000100" "Replying in thread"
slack send "https://acme.slack.com/archives/C0123456789/p1700000000000100" "Replying in thread"

# @handle tokens are auto-converted to real <@USERID> mentions (on by default; also on `edit`).
# Resolves via users.list, then the channel's members so Slack Connect guests work;
# any handle that can't be resolved is left as plain text. The confirm preview shows
# the converted message before sending. Use --no-mentions to keep @text literal.
slack send "#general" "thanks @t.yamada19850101 and @alice"
slack send "#general" "ping @ops on call" --no-mentions   # leave @ops as plain text

# Edit or delete a sent message (same confirm-code gate)
slack edit "<permalink>" "fixed wording"
slack delete "<permalink>"

# React instead of replying for a simple ack — keeps the thread tidy (no confirm gate)
# 👀 seen  ✅ done  ⏳ working on it — target is the #chan:<ts> / permalink form
slack react "#general:1700000000.000100" white_check_mark
slack react "<permalink>" eyes --remove   # take a reaction back

# Ask a question with its choices pre-seeded as 1️⃣..🔟 reactions — answering is
# one tap on an existing pill, no emoji picker. Same two-step confirm gate as send.
# A ❓ "その他 (other)" pill always follows the choices: pressing it means "none of
# these" and the answer comes as a reply (exit 5), not as the ❓ itself.
# The instructions are posted in ja or en: --lang / SLACK_TERM_LANG, else the
# answerers' Slack locale, else the question's own language, else $LANG, else ja.
slack ask "@bob" "本番に出してよい?" "出してよい" "待って"
# --wait blocks until answered and prints ONLY the answer on stdout, so it composes:
ANS=$(slack ask "@bob" "本番に出してよい?" "出してよい" "待って" --code=<code> --wait)
# exit 0 = answered, 2 = timed out (--timeout, default 3600s), 3 = transport failure,
# 4 = a reply matched several choices, 6 = the question was voided, 5 = a free-text reply that picked NO choice —
# the reply text is on stdout, it is not a decision, and the question stays open.
#
# The question must say WHO may answer — only their reaction/reply is taken as the
# answer, so a bystander can't decide it for them. `ask` refuses to post otherwise.
slack ask "#eng" "@alice この PR 出してよい?" "出す" "待つ"     # only alice's answer counts
slack ask "#eng" "@here 誰か見れる?" "見る" "あとで"            # anyone in #eng; real broadcast
# (In a 1:1 DM the other party counts automatically — no tag needed.)
#
# With no choices the question asks for a free-text reply and the reply is the answer.
# In a DM a plain reply counts; in a channel only reactions and thread replies do.
# Once answered, the question is edited to "✅ …回答済み > <answer>" — the body/background
# and the CHOSEN option line stay; the other options, ❓ line and instructions go. The
# unpressed seeds are removed, leaving the chosen pill visible.
#
# Thread notes (audience replies that are not the answer, even after ✅) go to
# stderr; --json puts {answer, notes[], cursor} on stdout. Feed cursor back as --after:
#   slack ask --waitFor='<permalink>' --timeout 0 --json --after=<cursor>
#
# Retire a question that expired / stopped meaning anything (作废) — waits on it exit 6:
#   slack ask --void='<permalink>' --reason 'head moved' --superseded-by '<new permalink>'
# Change one: slack ask --edit='<permalink>' ["new question" [choices…]] [--body …]
#   (options only while unanswered; after that: --void='<permalink>' --reask …)
# List mine with live state: slack ask --ls [--stale 24h] [--state all] [--json]
# (`slack edit` refuses an edit that would break an ask/poll; --force overrides.)
#
# WITHOUT --wait, stdout is the command that collects the answer later:
RESUME=$(slack ask "@bob" "本番に出してよい?" "出してよい" "待って" --code=<code>)
#   -> slack ask --waitFor='https://acme.slack.com/archives/C00000001/p1700000000000100'
# Run it whenever you like: it re-reads the question from Slack, so nothing is
# stored locally and any machine holding the link can collect. Same stdout/exit
# contract as --wait, plus --timeout 0 = check once (exit 2 while still open, 5 with
# the reply on stdout if somebody wrote free text instead of choosing; re-wait past
# it with --after=<reply ts>),
# which is what a periodic monitor should use instead of parking on --wait.
eval "$RESUME --timeout 0" && echo answered
# A pressed pill is invisible to `slack tail` (it only sees `type: "message"`
# events and drops `message_changed`), so this is the only way to hear about an
# answer to a question you did not block on.

# Who sent what: every send/ask/poll/edit is logged locally with its sender —
# pid, cwd, git branch, agent CLI and session id — and the same attribution rides
# along as invisible Slack message metadata (event_type `slack_term_sent`).
slack sent                                     # newest first, sender on its own line
slack sent "deploy" --since 2h --kind ask      # substring of the text
slack sent --session 4f1c --cwd ~/ws/app --json
# Log: ~/.config/slack-cli/sent.sqlite (SLACK_TERM_SENT_DB overrides).
# Opt out of both with SLACK_TERM_ATTRIBUTION=off. Agent CLIs other than Claude
# Code are found by process name; set SLACK_TERM_AGENT_SESSION / _CLI / _PID to
# name the session explicitly.

# Task tracking on top of reactions — :pushpin: marks a message as a task,
# a second reaction carries its progress (see "todo" below)
slack todo ls                                  # my open tasks
slack todo ls --state untriaged --in "#general"
slack todo set "#general:1700000000.000100" doing
slack todo flag "<permalink>" blocked
slack todo doctor --in "#general"              # find messages stuck in two states

# Bulk export channel history
slack dump --days 7 --filter eng

# Stream new messages in real time (Ctrl-C to stop)
slack tail "#general"
slack tail "#general" --since=10m   # backfill last 10 minutes first
slack tail "#general" --thread=<ts> # follow a single thread
slack tail "#general" --me          # only messages that mention you
slack tail "@bob" --exit-on-message --timeout 30m   # wait for a reply, then exit
```

### todo — task tracking on reactions

Tasks are just messages. A **marker** reaction (📌 `:pushpin:`) says "this is a task";
a **progress** reaction says where it stands; **reason flags** stack on top:

| axis | reaction | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| progress 1 | ✅ `white_check_mark` | done |
| progress 2 | 🚫 `no_entry_sign` | dropped |
| progress 3 | 👀 `eyes` | doing |
| progress 4 | ⏳ `hourglass_flowing_sand` | pending |
| progress 5 | *(marker only)* | undefined / untriaged |
| flag | ❗ `exclamation` | alert |
| flag | ❓ `question` | needs discussion |
| flag | 💬 `speech_balloon` | waiting — the other party in this conversation owes a reply |
| flag | 🔒 `lock` | blocked — stuck on something *outside* this conversation |

The invariant is **"at least one progress reaction, readers collapse by priority"** —
not "exactly one". A message carrying both ✅ and 👀 reads as *done*.

**Whose ball is it?** There are only three answers, and `pending` ⏳ already means *mine*.
The other two are the flags:

- 💬 **waiting** — I've done my part; someone **in this conversation** owes the next move
  (I asked a question, I'm waiting on a review, I sent it and need a yes/no).
- 🔒 **blocked** — the hold-up is **outside this conversation**: another task, a third
  party, an external dependency, a deploy window.

They stack with each other and with ❗/❓; `--state stuck` matches a task with any of them.

```sh
# Two listings, split by whose reactions count — the distinction is the command,
# not a flag, so "everyone's list" and "my list" can't be confused at a glance.
slack todo ls                              # EVERYONE's tasks (has:)
slack mytodo ls                            # only tasks YOU reacted to (hasmy:)

slack todo ls --state untriaged            # marked, no progress reaction yet
slack todo ls --state doing --in "#eng"    # scoped to a channel
slack mytodo ls --state stuck              # my unfinished tasks carrying a reason flag
slack todo ls --state stuck --from "@alice" # …and it was alice who wrote it
slack todo ls --from me                    # tasks on my own messages (any reactor)
slack todo ls --mine                       # same as `slack mytodo ls`
slack todo set "#eng:1700000000.000100" doing
slack todo flag "<permalink>" waiting          # their ball now
slack todo flag "<permalink>" needs-discussion
slack todo flag "<permalink>" blocked --remove
slack todo doctor --in "#eng"              # report messages in two progress states
slack todo doctor --in "#eng" --fix        # keep the highest-priority one
```

Notes:

- **`todo ls` vs `mytodo ls`** — `todo ls` matches anyone's reactions (`has:`), `mytodo ls`
  only your own (`hasmy:`). Everything else about them is identical. Both print a
  `From: @handle (Uxxxx) — Workspace` line first, because `hasmy:` resolves against
  whichever account the token belongs to — "my tasks" means nothing until you know who
  *my* is, and a stale profile otherwise lists someone else's list without saying so.
  (`todo ls --mine` is a one-off shortcut to the narrow view.)
- Both are read-only and run **exactly one** `search.messages` call — priority is expressed
  as negated `has:`/`hasmy:` terms in the query, not as multiple searches
  (`search.messages` is Tier 2, ~20 req/min). Slack's search index lags a little
  behind `reactions.add`, so a just-set task may take a moment to appear.
- `todo set` **adds the new reaction before removing the old ones**, and removes serially.
  The reverse order would leave a window with no progress reaction at all — a crash or a
  429 there would drop the task out of every query with nothing left pointing at it.
  Worst case here is a message with two progress reactions, which reads correctly and is
  repairable with `todo doctor --fix`.
- `--from <@user|me>` maps to search's `from:` modifier (a missing `@` is supplied; `me`
  passes through as-is). Reactions carry no reference to *whom* a task waits on, but the
  sender is usually that person — so filtering by author answers most of the question for
  free. It composes with `--in` in the same single search.
- **Not implemented, deliberately:** encoding the actual reference ("blocked on @alice" /
  "blocked on task X") as a machine-readable token in a thread reply. Measured: Slack's
  full-text index splits on punctuation, so a quoted search for `"blocked-on"` returns 0
  hits, and `"1.91"` matches `1.91.0`. A token like `todo:v1 blocked-on=@alice` is therefore
  unsearchable. Any future attempt needs a single alphanumeric marker word (e.g. `tdblock`)
  plus a bare `@mention`.
- `todo doctor` pages history sequentially and scans at most `--limit` messages
  (default 1000); if it hits the limit it says so rather than silently stopping.
- Emoji are configurable in `~/.config/slack-cli/todo.json` (same directory as
  `profiles.json`); anything omitted falls back to the defaults above:

  ```json
  { "marker": "round_pushpin", "progress": { "doing": "construction" } }
  ```

- Channel-name→ID and user-ID→handle lookups are cached in
  `~/.config/slack-cli/cache.json` for 1 hour, namespaced by workspace (`team_id`) since
  both are workspace-scoped; `--no-cache` bypasses it. Reaction state and search results
  are **never** cached — they are exactly the values that change, and Slack's search index
  already lags. A corrupt or unwritable cache is ignored and the command runs uncached.

### pinlog — a pinned status board that keeps a log

A **pinlog** is one pinned top-level message that always holds the *current* state
(HEAD), plus a thread under it with one short reply per change (the log). The HEAD is
**edited in place, which is silent**; each log reply **notifies**. People who want the
state read the pin; people who want to know what changed follow the thread. Good for
anything people come back to: blocker boards, release readiness, incidents — one board
per topic.

```bash
slack pinlog ls  "#gtm"                     # boards in a channel (found by their footer)
slack pinlog get <board>                    # state + log   (--json for one object)
slack pinlog new "#gtm" "販売ブロッカー\n1. 見積テンプレ — 未" ["why this board exists"]
slack pinlog set <board> "<the WHOLE new state>" "見積テンプレ: 未 → 済"
slack pinlog set <board> --file board.md "見積テンプレ: 未 → 済"   # state from a file (- = stdin)
slack pinlog note <board> "まだ法務待ち — 再送済"                   # reason only, state unchanged
```

`<board>` is the board's permalink, `#chan:ts`, or the `C…:ts` id `new` prints. There
are no names and nothing is stored locally: a board *is* its Slack message, so the same
command works from any machine. Each verb takes only its own kind of target — `new` and
`ls` a channel, the rest a board — so a pasted channel can never turn an intended update
into a second board.

- Every HEAD ends with a footer, `_Pinlog · 最終更新 2026-10-08 15:10 JST · 更新はスレッドに_`,
  refreshed on each update. `ls` finds boards by it, and `set` **refuses** a message
  without it, so a wrong link cannot overwrite an ordinary message.
  To turn an existing hand-run board into a pinlog on purpose, pass `set --adopt` once.
- `new`, `set` and `note` use the same two-step `--code` gate as `send`/`edit`, and the
  preview shows the situation, not just your text: `new` lists boards already in the
  channel (usually a sign you meant `set`), and `set` shows the current state next to
  the new one. The `set` code covers the current state, so if someone else changed the
  board after your preview, your code stops matching and you re-read first.
- **`set` order:** the state edit first, then the reason reply. If the edit fails, **no**
  reason is posted. If the reply fails, the command exits 1, says the state *is* updated,
  and prints the exact retry (`slack pinlog note <board> '…' --code=…`).
  A failure that *may* have landed (network error, Slack `internal_error`/`fatal_error`)
  is reported as `UNKNOWN`, not `NOT posted`, with the `get`/`ls` command to check
  first, because a blind retry would post a second board or a second notifying reply.
  A HEAD over Slack's 40,000-character limit is refused before posting, because Slack
  would truncate the footer.
- `new` without the pin scope still creates the board: it says `NOT pinned`, prints
  the `slack pinlog pin <board>` command, and exits 0, because retrying `new` would make a
  second board. Pinning needs `pins:write` on the token you act with.
- `--as-bot` acts as the bot for reads and writes. Slack lets a token edit only its own
  messages, so a board the bot created must be updated `--as-bot`.
- During quiet hours (JST 23:00–08:00) the preview shows the quiet-hours line, and the
  confirmed run warns that the reply notified. It warns but does not block.
- Text is posted as-is (plain mrkdwn, no blocks) so the footer reads back verbatim;
  `@handle`s are **not** converted — write `<@U…>` if you need a real mention.
- Stateless: the only local files are short-lived per-board locks, held while a `set` runs,
  so two writers on one machine cannot interleave.

### tail — real-time message stream

`slack tail` polls a channel every 3 seconds (configurable via `--interval`) and
prints new messages as they arrive, in the same `[ts]  @handle:  text` format as
the `read` command.

```sh
slack tail "#general"               # follow new messages from now
slack tail "#general" --since=30m   # backfill 30 minutes, then stream
slack tail "#general" --thread=1700000000.000100   # one thread only
slack tail "#general" --me          # only messages mentioning you
```

For automation, `--exit-on-message` stops as soon as the first message from
**someone else** arrives (your own posts are ignored), and `--timeout <dur>`
(e.g. `30m`, `2h`) auto-stops after the deadline with exit code 0. Together they
make a "wait for a reply, then act" primitive that won't hang:

```sh
slack tail "@alice" --exit-on-message --timeout 30m --interval 15000
```

**Note:** Cross-channel mention streaming (`--me` without a target) is not yet
supported — a target channel is required.

### stream — every matching message, across all channels

`slack stream --grep <regex>` watches **every** conversation the identity is in —
new top-level posts *and* thread replies — and prints each message whose text
matches. It is the cross-channel counterpart of `tail`, built for a long-running
consumer (e.g. "wake an agent whenever someone @mentions the bot"):

```sh
slack stream --grep '<@U00000001>|@mybot' --json            # runs until stopped
slack stream --grep 'deploy' -i --channel '#dev' --once       # one scan, then exit
slack stream --grep '<@U00000001>' --since 2h --json          # replay the last 2 hours
slack stream --grep '<@U00000001>' --replies-to self --json   # + every reply in threads the bot is in
```

- **One JSON line per match** with `--json`:
  `{type: "message"|"reply", channel: {id, name}, ts, thread_ts, user: {id, name}, text, permalink, match}`,
  where `match` is `"grep"` or `"replies-to"`.
  `--grep` runs on the raw text (mentions look like `<@U…>`), plus legacy attachment
  text; the emitted `text` has `&lt; &gt; &amp;` decoded.
- **Privacy-safe defaults.** With a bot token (`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`) it streams **as the
  bot**, so it sees only channels the bot was invited to — never the user's DMs.
  `--as-user` opts into the user identity. Matching happens before anything is
  printed: a non-matching message is never printed, logged, or even name-resolved.
- **Replies in a user's threads.** `--replies-to <user-id>` (repeatable; `self` = the
  streaming identity) also prints every reply in a thread that user started or has
  replied in, whether or not it matches `--grep` — people answer a bot in its thread
  without tagging it. It matches Slack's `parent_user_id`, the parent's
  `reply_users`, and the id's own replies the stream has seen (kept in the state
  file for 30 days). `reply_users` lists at most five people, so a thread cut short
  there is read once in full (as is one whose list is missing). A bot can appear
  as its user id (`U…`) or bot id (`B…`); `self`, or a `B…` id, covers both. Polling only reaches threads inside `--thread-window`;
  with the relay, a reply in an older thread is caught too.
- **No self-echo.** Posts by the streaming identity are excluded by sender id (its user
  id and bot id; with `--as-user`, the bot's posts too) — the same text from anyone
  else still matches.
- **Resumable.** A per-channel cursor (plus one per active thread) is saved under
  `$XDG_STATE_HOME/slack-term/stream/` (one file per identity + grep + channels + `--replies-to`;
  override with `--state`). A restart continues where it stopped: nothing lost,
  nothing repeated. The first run starts *now*; `--since` replays from a point,
  ignoring the saved cursor. Delivery is at-least-once only in one corner — a crash
  between printing a match and saving the cursor repeats that line, so dedupe on
  `channel.id + ts`. A lock file keeps two streams off the same state.
- **Transport: polling** (`--interval`, default `45s`). Each cycle reads every
  channel's history over a sliding `--thread-window` (default `3d`): that one scan
  shows new posts and which threads gained replies, and only those threads are read.
  A message is held back until it is 5 s old, so a cursor never skips one Slack has
  not made visible yet. Rate limits honour `Retry-After`.
- **Real time, optionally: the relay.** Set `SLACK_RELAY_URL` and `SLACK_RELAY_TOKEN`
  to a deployed [`worker/`](worker/) (a Cloudflare Worker on Slack's Events API) and
  the stream hears a *doorbell* — `{channel, ts, thread_ts}`, no text — within a
  second of each post, then reads that one message through the Web API with its own
  token and runs it through the same `--grep`. While the relay is connected the poll
  still runs, every `--reconcile` (default `5m`), as the safety net; when the relay
  is down it goes back to `--interval`. Both paths share one record of what was
  printed, so a message is never printed twice. The relay is used only when
  streaming as the bot (it rings for the bot's channels) and never with `--once`;
  `--no-relay` turns it off.
- **Not covered:** edits (a message edited *into* matching is not re-emitted), and —
  without the relay — replies in a thread whose parent is older than `--thread-window`.
- **Failures are loud and distinguishable.** A network/API error retries the cycle
  with φ backoff (`2s·1.618ⁿ`, capped at 5 min), one stderr line per attempt; after
  12 consecutive failures (≈16 min) it exits. A channel it cannot read is skipped with
  one stderr line; if *every* channel fails, that is a failure, not "no matches".
- **Exit codes** (same contract as `ask`): `0` matches printed (`--once`) or stopped by
  SIGINT/SIGTERM; `2` `--once` found nothing; `3` transport/auth failure (stderr says
  which); `1` bad arguments (e.g. an invalid regex).

## Configuration

Requires a Slack user token (`xoxp-...`) with the following scopes:

- `search:read` — for search and news
- `channels:history`, `groups:history`, `im:history`, `mpim:history` — for message history
- `channels:read`, `groups:read`, `im:read`, `mpim:read` — for channel listing
- `users:read` — for resolving display names
- `chat:write` — for sending messages
- `reactions:write` — for `react` and for `ask` (seeding / clearing the choice pills)

`ask` needs no `reactions:read`: it reads the answers back from
`conversations.history`, which returns each message's `reactions` (with the user
list) under the `*:history` scopes above. `reactions.get` would need
`reactions:read`, so it is deliberately not used.

> Add each scope to the **token type the CLI actually uses**. The CLI defaults to the
> **user token** (`xoxp-...`), so `reactions:write` must be under **User Token Scopes**.
> Adding it only to **Bot Token Scopes** makes `slack doctor` (which checks the bot
> token) look green while `slack react` still fails with `missing_scope` — the bot scope
> only helps `--as-bot`/bot-token usage. After changing scopes, **reinstall the app** to
> the workspace for it to take effect.

Set the token via environment variable:

```sh
export SLACK_MCP_XOXP_TOKEN=xoxp-...
```

Or place it in `~/.config/slack-cli/.env` or a local `.env` file.

See [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) for a full token-acquisition walkthrough.

### Ubuntu desktop session

Sign in to Slack in Chrome or Slack Desktop. `--from-chrome` reads a browser `xoxc-` token and cookie from the same Chrome profile; desktop import reads `xoxc-` tokens from native, Snap, or Flatpak data directories. Browser profiles contain sensitive cookies, so the CLI asks `Read local browser profiles and Slack session cookies? [y/N]` before scanning. Enter `y` to allow a scan; the default is no.

```sh
slack auth login --from-desktop                 # desktop token only
slack auth login --from-chrome                  # Chrome token + Chrome cookie
slack auth login --from-firefox                 # desktop token + Firefox cookie
slack auth login --from-all                     # desktop and browser sources
slack auth login --from-chrome --yes            # bypass the browser-read prompt
slack auth tokens                              # print active credentials in .env format
slack auth save --envfile=./.env.local          # export active token + cookie
```

`--from-all` attaches a cookie only when exactly one browser session is found. If several are found, the desktop token is saved without a cookie; use `slack auth chrome -w <name>` or `slack auth firefox -w <name>` to select the matching profile. These commands also ask before reading browser profiles, and accept `--yes` for scripts. Select the saved workspace with `slack auth use -g <name>`. `auth tokens` prints the active `SLACK_TOKEN`, optional `SLACK_COOKIE`, and optional `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` to stdout; treat its output as secret. `auth save` requires a cookie, writes `SLACK_TOKEN` and `SLACK_COOKIE`, and makes the env file owner-readable only on Unix. `--workspace <name>` selects a specific profile.

Chrome supports Linux `v10` cookies and `v11` cookies when `secret-tool` can read the unlocked GNOME keyring. Other Linux keyring backends are not yet supported. Firefox discovery covers native, Snap, and Flatpak profiles. If browser session access is unavailable, use `slack auth token` to add a user token from a Slack app. Treat desktop tokens and browser cookies as credentials; keep profile files and local env files private.

## Development

```sh
# TypeScript
bun install
bun run dev -- news --limit 3      # run straight from source
bun run typecheck
bun run build                      # produces dist/cli.js

# Rust
cargo run --manifest-path rs/Cargo.toml --release --bin slack -- news --limit 3

# Parity test (requires a token — compares Rust and TS stdout)
bun run test:parity
```

## Dependencies

**TypeScript impl** — zero runtime deps; uses built-in `fetch`, `node:crypto`,
`node:util` argument parsing.

**Rust impl**

- [clap](https://crates.io/crates/clap) — CLI argument parsing
- [reqwest](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest) — HTTP client for Slack Web API

- [chrono](https://crates.io/crates/chrono) — date/time formatting
- [ring](https://crates.io/crates/ring) — SHA-256 for confirm hashes

## Release notes

### v0.x — 2026-05-15: `slack tail`

New `tail` subcommand streams channel messages in real time using poll-based
delivery (3-second interval). Supports `--since=<duration>` for backfill,
`--thread=<ts>` to follow a single thread, and `--me` to filter for messages
that mention you. Uses `conversations.history?oldest=<ts>` as a cursor so
already-seen messages are never re-printed, even across reconnects.

## Ecosystem

This CLI is the human-comms surface of the
[agent-yes](https://github.com/snomiao/agent-yes) fleet: agent-yes runs, watches and
delegates to AI coding agents, and `slack` is how they read and answer the humans they
work with. Neither depends on the other — they share a stance rather than a library:
file-based state over daemons, one command surface across two runtimes, gates on the
irreversible and warnings on the merely unwise, and no real operational data in a public
repo.

A write-up of the design decisions behind the confirm gate lives on the agent-yes lab:

### Print the active token (TypeScript CLI)

`slack auth token` prints the resolved token followed by a newline, like
`gh auth token`. Select a saved workspace with `slack auth token --workspace acme`.
It uses the same environment/profile precedence as other commands and makes no
API request. Diagnostics go to stderr so stdout can be used in scripts.

Use `slack auth login` for interactive setup. Existing imports with
`slack auth token --token <token> --name acme` continue to work.

`slack auth env` prints the active workspace credentials as quoted dotenv
assignments (`SLACK_TOKEN`, plus `SLACK_COOKIE` for desktop tokens when available).
Use `slack auth env --workspace acme` to select a specific saved workspace.
It follows the same credential precedence, makes no API request, and prints only
assignments to stdout. Each export contains one workspace, avoiding duplicate keys.
